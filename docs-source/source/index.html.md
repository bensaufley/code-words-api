# Introduction

The [Code Words API](https://github.com/bensaufley/code-words-api) is an API for playing the game Code Words. It is built as a compliment to [Code Words Web](https://github.com/bensaufley/code-words-api), a web client-based React project, with the aim of potentially creating something in React-Native or Swift to consume this same API at some future date.
